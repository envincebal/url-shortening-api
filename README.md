# Shortly URL shortening API Challenge

## Overview 

This application uses the [shrtcode](https://shrtco.de/) API to turn any valid URL into a shortened form. This allows user to copy the shortened link to the clipboard and paste it easily. If the URL is invalid, it returns an error. This project emphasizes heavily on responsive design, flexbox and error handling.
